This is a feature branch update for demonstration.

A collection of Bash scripts that automate common Linux system tasks.
This project is part of my DevOps learning journey and portfolio.

backup.sh → Creates a timestamped backup of a directory.

netcheck.sh → Tests internet connectivity.

git clone https://github.com/SalehSulieman/linux-automation-scripts.git
cd linux-automation-scripts

Make the scripts executable:

chmod +x *.sh

Run them:

./sysinfo.sh
./backup.sh
./netcheck.sh

Requirements

Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
Bash shell

## Git Workflow Demonstration

This repository also demonstrates a professional Git workflow:
- Creating and working on a feature branch (`feature-update-readme`)
- Making and committing changes
- Merging the feature branch into `main`
- Cleaning up the branch after merge
- Tagging a release (`v0.1.0`)
